Portfolio:
The portfolio website is a thoughtfully designed personal showcase created to highlight skills, projects, and achievements. Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it combines creativity and technical proficiency to deliver a seamless user experience. The website features a clean and modern layout, with intuitive navigation that allows visitors to explore professional accomplishments, technical expertise, and personal interests effortlessly. The design ensures responsiveness, making it functional across various devices. However, to fully experience its interactive features and visual appeal, it is recommended to view the demo in desktop mode. This project reflects a commitment to crafting professional and visually engaging web applications.
